As always, there are limitations to what is freely available on the Internet, including Github.  Apparently, the .mp4 files for my Final Project presentation are too large for Github to display on the Web.

Thanks to the local housecats, the presentation videos are already divided into 3 pieces.  I used another free tool, [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/), to convert the original .mp4 files to a format small enough to be emailed and to be uploaded to GitHub.

The three videos are:

* [Richardson Stem 103 Final Project Part 1 Of 3](https://github.com/yvonne-ongithub/level-3-project-presentation-yvonne-ongithub/blob/main/Richardson%20Stem%20103%20Final%20Project%20Part%201%20Of%203.mp4)
* [Richardson Stem 103 Final Project Part 2 Of 3](https://github.com/yvonne-ongithub/level-3-project-presentation-yvonne-ongithub/blob/main/Richardson%20Stem%20103%20Final%20Project%20Part%202%20Of%203.mp4)
* [Richardson Stem 103 Final Project Part 3 Of 3](https://github.com/yvonne-ongithub/level-3-project-presentation-yvonne-ongithub/blob/main/Richardson%20Stem%20103%20Final%20Project%20Part%203%20Of%203.mp4)

If you can get GitHub to allow you to access the videos as is, more power to you.

However, when you click on the videos, it is likely to tell you:<br/><b><i> "(Sorry about that, but we canâ€™t show files that are this big right now.)"</i></b>.
<br/><br/>Directly underneath the message, there is a link named $${\color{blue}view\space raw}$$ which should allow you to download the files, whereupon you can view them on your own computer with any player that uses .mp4 files.

#### Attempt 2

The three videos are available for viewing with no Github limits on my portfolio site, http://www.ormer.net/eductech/. The topic is named "STEM103 Python Final Project".

Or, you can view the last two videos below. If there is time to divide the first video into pieces, which is a favorite coding technique, I will post it here.
